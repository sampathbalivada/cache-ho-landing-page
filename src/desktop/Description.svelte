        <strong>"How?"</strong> you ask. Factually, we are a group of engineers
        and our idea is to bring a change in the scenario of
        <strong>“ENGINEERING”</strong>
        in 2 states of India, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana which produces a lot
        of engineers. We are doing this to prove that Engineering is an art and
        not just a degree by bringing
        <i>
            real engineering experiences, podcasts, technical blogs, and many
            more
        </i>
        to the table. There you go then! Explore our page to understand the value
        we provide.

    <p>Happy Engineering :)</p>
